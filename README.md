# dvd-rental-database-analysis

## Project Overview

This project utilizes SQL queries to analyze a database containing data from a DVD rental company. As a reference, you can use the Sakila Movie Database, which comprises 15 tables and can be accessed [here](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-getting-started/postgresql-sample-database/). The objective is to conduct a comprehensive data analysis process, from formulating questions to running SQL queries and presenting findings.

### Files Included
- **DVD Rental ER Diagram:** This diagram illustrates the entity relationships within the database.
- **queries.txt:** Contains the SQL queries used for analysis.
- **report.pdf:** Visualization of analysis results based on the queries from `queries.txt`.

### Technology Used
To execute the SQL queries, PostgreSQL must be installed on your local machine. Instructions for installation can be found [here](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/).

## Results
Four queries were formulated to address the following questions:

1. **How many times have family movies been rented out categorized by category?**
   
2. **How does the length of rental duration compare to the duration that all movies are rented for within each family-friendly movie category?**

3. **How do the two stores compare in terms of the count of rental orders they fulfilled during each month every year?**

4. **Who were the top 10 paying customers, and what was the amount of the monthly payments they made in 2007?**

The analysis results are presented in the provided `report.pdf` file.

## Credits
- **Udacity Nanodegree Program:** Programming for Data Science with Python.
